Aladi, who was abducted while working as a guard at a warehouse, was found by Israeli commandos in an underground tunnel, following precise intelligence. After his rescue, Aladi was taken to a hospital in Israel, where he is now recovering and has been reunited with his family. Despite the success of this operation, there are reports suggesting that Aladi may have escaped on his own before being found. This rescue comes amid ongoing efforts to secure the release of over a hundred other hostages, with a ceasefire deal still out of reach. \"\n",
